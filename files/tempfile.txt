FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system 
for the i386, amd64, IA-64, arm, MIPS, p
owerpc, ppc64, PC-98 and UltraSPARC plat
forms based on U.C. Berkeley's "4.4BSD-L
ite" release, with some "4.4BSD-Lite2" e
nhancements. It is also based indirectly
 on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkel
ey's "Net/2" to the i386, known as "386B
SD", though very little of the 386BSD co
de remains. FreeBSD is used by companies
, Internet Service Providers, researcher
s, computer professionals, students and 
home users all over the world in their w
ork, education and recreation. FreeBSD c
omes with over 20,000 packages (pre-comp
iled software that is bundled for easy i
nstallation), covering a wide range of a
reas: from server software, databases an
d web servers, to desktop software, game
s, web browsers and business software - 
all free and easy to install.
