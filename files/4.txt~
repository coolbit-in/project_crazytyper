The climate in our country is very pleasant. It¡¯s always warm in spring, hot in summer and cold in winter.
My favourite season is autumn, because it¡¯s always warm in September and October. It¡¯s often cold in November. It¡¯s certainly interesting. The other reason is the days are short and the nights are long. The sun rises late and sets early. I can do my favourite things in the evening.
Autumn is a harvest season. I can make great progress in autumn. I like the golden season, and you?
